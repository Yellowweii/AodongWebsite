                        <div class="content">Once-through cooling is, by far, the most common method. In once through cooling, water is pumped from a river, lake, reservoir or ocean and then returned directly back to the source. There are pros and cons to once-through cooling. The cons, such as water scarcity and thermal pollution are leading the industry to evaluate alternate cooling options.
                 <br>           The use of recirculating cooling systems such as cooling towers, and the use of recycled water is increasing.
                <br>            All cooling water requires filtration! Cooling tower water, recycled water and surface water supplies can be contaminated by airborne debris, silt, sand, pollen, algae, and other suspended solids. All these water sources can also be contaminated with pipe scale and corrosion by-products. As the contaminants circulate through the system and deposit on the heat transfer surfaces, they cause a reduction in heat transfer efficiency and reduced power generation efficiency. When you lose heat transfer efficiency, then you need to pump more cooling water to realize the same cooling. The net effect of contamination is increased water consumption and reduced power generation efficiency.</div>

                <div class="content col-sm-12">Your public water authority does the best it can to provide you with potable water. However, water passing through a series of pipes to reach your home may contain sediment. Therefore, a sediment reduction filter is advisable on the incoming water line. Our whole house filtration systems help protect washers and seals from premature wear, help prevent aerators and valves from plugging and help keep your water heater from collecting excessive sediment. Additionally, if you do not care for the taste of your home's tap water, a whole house water filter system that reduces not only sediment but chlorine, taste and odor as well. <br> Keep in mind that contaminant levels may vary depending on the season or the weather. Additionally, in the case of lead, the contaminant may not be accurately represented in water quality reports, as it may originate in a home piping system.</div>
                <div class="smalltitle col-sm-12">What substances can be reduced by Orientfiltr water filtration products?</div>
                <div class="content col-sm-12">Our products vary in respect to ratings for contaminant reduction; among our line of offerings are products that reduce chlorine taste and odor, trihalomethane (TTHM), lead, sediment, cysts, arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium (hex), chromium (tri), copper, fluoride, radium, selenium, turbidity, total dissolved solids (TDS), mercury, asbestos, chloramine, MTBE and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).</div>
                <div class="smalltitle col-sm-12">How often should a sediment cartridge be changed?</div>
                <div class="content col-sm-12">Cartridge life may vary by product system and local water conditions. Product packaging will indicate approximate life of each system. Please use this as the guide to how often you need to change your filter. If you notice a drop in water pressure, it is recommended that you change your filter.</div>
                <div class="smalltitle col-sm-12"> How often should a taste/odor cartridge be changed? </div>
                <div class="content col-sm-12">Taste/odor cartridges should be changed when the off taste or odor returns, when a drop in pressure sediment is noticed, or every 4 to 6 months, whichever occurs first.</div>
